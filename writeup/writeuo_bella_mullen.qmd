## Introduction TOMORROW

Introductions can be just 1-2 paragraphs clarifying the main idea of the original study, the target finding for replication, and any other essential information. It will NOT have a literature review -- that is in the original publication. You can write both the introduction and the methods in past tense.

The original study examined how the speed of decision-making affects evaluations of an individual’s moral character. Researchers hypothesized that observers interpret quick moral or immoral decisions as a signal of the actor’s certainty, which suggests a clearer alignment with either morally good or bad dispositions. Two experiments tested this by presenting participants with scenarios where actors either quickly or slowly decided to keep or return a found wallet. Results showed that actors who made quick decisions to act morally were evaluated more positively, whereas quick decisions to act immorally led to more negative evaluations. This polarized effect was mediated by perceived decision certainty, as quick decisions were assumed to reflect strong moral or immoral convictions. The study’s findings underscore the role of decision speed as a social cue in moral judgment, suggesting that the speed of moral decision-making can influence how others perceive underlying moral character.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size. Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

To collect data jsPsych will be used to create a publicly accessible online experiment. Below is the scenario and questions the participants will be asked. This follows the original article exactly.

"Participants read about both Justin and Nate, two men who each independently came upon two separate cash-filled wallets in the parking lot of a local grocery store. Justin ‘‘was able to decide quickly’’ what to do. Nate ‘‘was only able to decide after long and careful deliberation.’’ Participants assigned to the moral condition learned both men ‘‘did not steal the money but instead left the wallet with customer service.’’ Those in the immoral condition learned instead that both men ‘‘pocketed the money and drove off.’'

Quickness. As a manipulation check, participants indicated how quickly (vs. slowly) the decision was made.

Moral character evaluation. The three moral evaluation items had participants assess the agents’ underlying moral principles and standards by asking whether the agent: ‘‘has entirely good (vs. entirely bad) moral principles,’’ ‘‘has good (vs. bad) moral standards,’’ and ‘‘deep down has the moral principles and knowledge to do the right thing.’’

Certainty. We included 4 items to assess each actor’s perceived decision certainty. Participants indicated ‘‘how con- flicted \[each\] felt when making his decision’’ (reverse-scored), ‘‘how many reservations \[each\] had’’ (reverse-scored), whether the target ‘‘was quite certain in his decision’’ (vs. had consid- erable reservations), and ‘‘how far \[each\] was from choosing the alternate course of action.’’

Emotional impulsivity. In order to ensure that decision speed was not simply taken as a proxy for emotional impulsivity (a feature previously shown to affect moral judgments; Pizarro, Uhlmann, & Salovey, 2003), we assessed perceptions of the emotionally impulsive nature of the decision with 2 items. Participants indicated to what extent the person remained ‘‘calm and emotionally contained’’ (reverse-scored) and ‘‘became upset and acted without thinking.’’"

### Procedure

The replication project will be replicating experiment 1. The following passages are quoted directly from the original article:

\- "Participants read about both Justin and Nate, two men who each independently came upon two separate cash-filled wallets in the parking lot of a local grocery store."

\- "Participants assigned to the moral condition learned both men ‘did not steal the money but instead left the wallet with customer service.’ Those in the immoral condition learned instead that both men 'pocketed the money and drove off.'"

\- "Immediately following the description of Justin and Nate’s actions, we asked participants the following sets of items (all on 1–7 scales): quickness, moral character evaluation, certainty, and emotional impulsivity."

### Analysis Plan

The key analysis of interest is how the speed of decision-making influences moral character evaluations. The analysis plan will follow the steps outlined in the original article. The analysis plan will cover a manipulation check, moral character evaluation, and perceived emotional impulsivity. The statistical test performed will be a two-way ANOVA, simple effects analysis, and mediation analysis. Data will be collected for the following variables: subject ID, immoral or moral condition, and a 1-7 ranking of quickness, moral character evaluation, certainty, and emotional impulsivity.

There will also be the exclusion of data that is incomplete or by participants who do not pass the attention check.

### Differences from Original Study

The three main differences between replication and the original study will be that the sample population will be random, there will be an attention check built in, and demographic information will be collected. The original article surveyed 119 undergraduate students the University of California, Berkeley, or members of the surrounding community. The replication trials will have a random sample population because the trials will be conduced online and open to the public. The difference in data collection should not have an effect on the findings but may allow generalization to a wider population.

An attention check will be added to the end of the study where participants will be asked to type the name of either of the characters from the scenarios they were presented. The addition of the attention check will help eliminate misleading or incomplete data that could come from participants who did not truly engage with the material.

The last difference is that two demographic questions will be added to the study about age and gender. This may allow for greater generalizability from the findings.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample

Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan

Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

## Results

### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan. Data preparation will include cleaning and exploring outliers. Responses that fall into the exclusion criteria (incomplete or attention test failed) will be removed.

### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The confirmatory analysis will be the Two-way Analysis of Variance. This text will examine whether perceived certainty influenced moral judgments by using the decision speed data. From the original article, "it will be a two-way 2 (decision) x 2 (speed) ANOVA on the relative motive composite returned a main effect of decision as well as the predicted Decision Speed interaction."

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt. None of these need to be long.
