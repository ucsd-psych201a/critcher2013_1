# Replication of How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character by Critcher et al. (2013)

This project replicates **Experiment 1 from "How Quick Decisions Illuminate Moral Character"**, which examines how decision-making speed influences perceptions of moral character. Participants will read scenarios about two characters who make moral or immoral decisions either quickly or slowly and will rate the characters on moral principles, certainty, impulsiveness, and quickness. The study aims to explore how decision speed and morality interact to shape judgments of moral character.
